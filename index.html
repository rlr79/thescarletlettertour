                <div class = "introductionWords">Protestantism was a new branch of Christianity.

    <h1>Chapter One</h1>
      <div class = "mapSection">
      <img src="sectionPhotos/prisonLarge.png" class = "map"/>
      The Boston Gaol was Boston's first prison. It has been replaced with a new building over the years, but was once situated at 26 Court Street. </div>
    <h2>The Prison Door</h2>
    <p>The novel begins by examining the irony within the colony’s layout, which includes a prison and cemetery. The existence of these locations reveals to readers that the first Puritans ultimately knew that establishing a Christian "utopia" to end human suffering and aggression was not possible.</p>
    <p>The prison itself has an ominous, spiked wooden door with a wild rose bush growing just outside of it. This symbolically shows that nature shares pity and kindness more indiscriminately than humankind.</p>
    <p>Once the setting is described, the author then states that the roses will relieve readers of the frailty and sorrow within the oncoming story, just as they comfort prisoners who walk through the prison door.</p>

    <h1>Chapter Two</h1>
      <div class = "mapSection">
      <img src="sectionPhotos/prisonScaffold.png" class = "map"/>
      The scaffold was located at the market. According to a <a href="https://www.masshist.org/database/resource.php?t=MHS%20Collections%20Online%3A%20Map%20of%20the%20Town%20of%20Boston%201648%3B%20Drawn%20by%20Samuel%20C.%20Clough%2C%20in%20Accordance%20with%20Information%20Compiled%20from%20the%20Records%20of%20the%20Colony%20...&i=/database/images/5104_work/5104_work.xml&u=https%3A//www.masshist.org/database/viewer.php%3Fitem_id%3D1736%26mode%3Dzoomify%26img_step%3D1%26" class="shadow" target="_blank">map</a> from the 1640s, the market was located at the intersection of present-day State Street and Congress Street.
      </div>
    <h2>The Market-Place</h2>
    <p>A crowd gathers to witness a public punishment.</p>
    <p>Punishments within the colony are decided both legally and religiously, although the difference is miniscule. Examples include expelling people with who have religious differences outside of Puritanism, banishing Natives who consume alcohol and become drunk, and persecuting people over accusations of witchcraft. </p>
    <p>At present, the Puritan women within the colony are focused on the accused: a woman named Hester Prynne.</p>
    <p>The women believe that their local minister, Reverend Dimmesdale, is especially aggrieved by her actions due to the fact that she was his congregant. It is also believed that her actions have tarnished the community, however her crimes have not yet been disclosed.</p>
    <p>Unable to attain a death sentence, the women discuss branding Hester’s forehead, saying that whatever item she will be condemned to wear as a punishment can easily be covered up.</p>
    <p>Soon, Hester determinedly exits from the prison, ascends the town’s scaffold, and holds a baby over her chest to clearly hide something on her bodice. Though Hester quickly accepts that she cannot hide either the baby or the item on her chest - which is an elaborately embroidered letter ‘A’ made from scarlet red cloth and gold thread. The scarlet letter stands for "adulterer," and Hester is condemned to wear the scarlet letter for the rest of her life. After showing the letter to the crowd, Hester immediately feels it secluding her from society.</p>
    <p>The women around Hester become angrier after seeing how beautifully she had embroidered the scarlet letter. They believe it is a mockery of the punishment and discuss wanting to rip off the letter and her gown, to replace them with unsightly alternatives.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Hester and her baby are described to readers as evoking the image of Mother Mary with Baby Jesus. Yet the crowd looks on with harsh glares instead. To Hester, their harsh judgement is described as being more painful than mockery.</p>
    <p>To mentally escape from her current situation, Hester begins to relive her past memories, including her marriage to a European scholar who had a physical anomaly where one shoulder sat higher than the other. After marrying, Hester came to New England alone without her husband, then found her way into her present situation - which she is just beginning to accept as her new reality.</p>

    <h1>Chapter Three</h1>
       <div class = "mapSection">
      <img src="sectionPhotos/scaffold.png" class = "map"/>
      The scaffold was located at the market. According to a <a href="https://www.masshist.org/database/resource.php?t=MHS%20Collections%20Online%3A%20Map%20of%20the%20Town%20of%20Boston%201648%3B%20Drawn%20by%20Samuel%20C.%20Clough%2C%20in%20Accordance%20with%20Information%20Compiled%20from%20the%20Records%20of%20the%20Colony%20...&i=/database/images/5104_work/5104_work.xml&u=https%3A//www.masshist.org/database/viewer.php%3Fitem_id%3D1736%26mode%3Dzoomify%26img_step%3D1%26" class="shadow" target="_blank">map</a> from the 1640s, the market was located at the intersection of present-day State Street and Congress Street.
      </div>
    <h2>The Recognition</h2>
    <p>At the edge of the crowd, Hester sees a Native man standing with a European man who has the same shoulder anomaly as her husband. Hester quickly realizes that her husband has arrived, and he slowly sees that Hester, his wife, is being punished. He presses his finger to his lips and signals for her to not reveal his presence, then asks a spectator about what is happening.</p>
    <p>Hester's husband acts as a random traveler and explains to the spectator that he was imprisoned by a Native tribe after arriving from Europe. The spectator then welcomes Hester's husband back to "European society", where “sin is searched out, and punished”. It is also explained that Hester had come from Amsterdam two years ago, but her husband never followed. Now, she has had a baby with someone else and refuses to reveal the father. This causes Hester's husband to feel frustrated with himself for not expecting this result after a two-year delay in following her.</p>
     <p>The spectator then explains that Hester must now stand on the scaffold for 3 hours, before wearing the scarlet letter for the rest of her life. He also notes how unfair it is for Hester to be punished alone, but believes that the father will be revealed with time.</p>
    <p>While Hester's husband learns about why she is in this present situation, she reflects on how it is better for her affair to be discovered by her husband in such a public way, rather than in private. As she reflects on her husband, the local leaders begin to speak, including the Governor, Minister John Wilson, and Minister Arthur Dimmesdale.</p>
    <p>Minister Wilson announces that he has pleaded with Minister Dimmesdale to force Hester to name the father. He states that it is needed for the sake of her soul, to demonstrate repentance, and for Dimmesdale to uphold his responsibilities as her Minister.</p>
     <p>Minister Dimmesdale is described as being young and well-spoken, due to his formal education in Europe. He is also viewed as being pure and angelic by the community around him.</p>
     <p>In response to Minister Wilson's public speech, Dimmesdale asks Hester to name the father, arguing that the father does not deserve any pity. He explains that naming the father would finally reveal his hypocrisy, as well as his sin. However, Hester still refuses, even when Reverend Wilson offers to remove the scarlet letter in exchange for the name of the father. Hester retorts by saying that her child will have a “heavenly father”, rather than a physical father. Dimmesdale then remarks on her generosity, puts his hand over his heart, and retreats from the scaffold.</p>
    <p>The other local leaders now begin to preach hours of lectures on sin to the public, using so many comparisons of the scarlet letter that everyone imagines it as being "flaming" and “infernal”. As this chappens, Hester's baby cries for the remainder of the entire event.</p>

    <h1>Chapter Four</h1>
      <div class = "mapSection">
      <img src="sectionPhotos/prison.png" class = "map"/>
      The Boston Gaol was Boston's first prison. It has been replaced with a new building over the years, but was once situated at 26 Court Street. </div>
    <h2>The Interview</h2>
    <p>After returning to the prison, Hester has an emotional breakdown. A doctor is then Orequested once it is apparent that Hester’s baby is also experiencing pain. A physician named Roger Chillingworth then enters, however Roger is Hester’s European husband in disguise.</p>
    <p>Alone together, Hester mistrusts her husband and fears that he will poison her baby. However, Chillingworth insists that he will not poison her child, and gives a drought which helps the baby to sleep instead. He then makes another drought for Hester while staring at her coldly.</p>
    <p>Still mistrustful, Hester says she does not want to drink a poison either. Chillingworth answers by saying that he would rather that she lives to suffer with the scarlet letter instead.</p>
    <p>As the conversation continues, Chillingworth torments Hester by frequently touching and mentioning the scarlet letter on her chest. He also discusses his self-anger for thinking that she could be happy with someone who is anti-social, older, and as physically different as him. He instead had hoped that his intellect would maintain her loyalty and attraction. Hester then counters by saying that she had always been open about feeling no love towards him. However, Chillingworth stubbornly responds that he always believed that his wish to find love through her would inspire her to love him back.</p>
    <p>Hester feels guilty after listening to Chillingworth, and says that she has betrayed him. Although Chillingworth counters by saying that they have betrayed each other. He explains that he does not want vengeance from her specifically, but from the father of the baby instead.</p>
    <p>Hester once again refuses to name the father, which results in the husband coldly promising to find him. He says that he will not publicly identify the father or kill him, but will punish the father instead.</p>
    <p>Before leaving, Chillingworth makes Hester promise to tell no one about their relationship. Instead, he wants to let the town believe that Hester’s husband is permanently gone, which would allow him to assume his new identity while avoiding sharing in the dishonor of her affair. Hester promises to uphold his secret just as she hides the father's identity.</p>
    <p>Chillingworth smiles hideously after hearing this answer, which makes Hester question the intention of the promise – though he assures her that the promise will not hurt her specifically.</p>

    <h1>Chapter Five</h1>
      <div class = "mapSection">
      <img src="sectionPhotos/cottage.png" class = "map"/>
          Hester's fictional cottage is described being on the west side of the colony, away from all residential properties. It sits on the coast and stares at the western-facing hills. Based on this description, and using a <a href="https://www.masshist.org/database/resource.php?t=MHS%20Collections%20Online%3A%20Map%20of%20the%20Town%20of%20Boston%201648%3B%20Drawn%20by%20Samuel%20C.%20Clough%2C%20in%20Accordance%20with%20Information%20Compiled%20from%20the%20Records%20of%20the%20Colony%20...&i=/database/images/5104_work/5104_work.xml&u=https%3A//www.masshist.org/database/viewer.php%3Fitem_id%3D1736%26mode%3Dzoomify%26img_step%3D1%26" class="shadow" target="_blank">map</a> from the 1640's which showed forrested terrain, the area where the fictional cottage would likely have been is highlighted in purple.
      </div>
    <h2>Hester at Her Needle</h2>
    <p>While leaving prison, Hester knows the scarlet letter will bring new challenges. She will be seen as embodying “women’s frailty and sinful passion" as well as the sin of adultery.</p>
    <p>Hester chooses to remain in the colony for various reasons. She now feels rooted and reborn from her sentencing, so much that her old life now feels foreign to her. Hester is also still in love with her baby's father, who lives nearby. She also tells herself that remaining will not only build penance, but will develop a new “saint-like” purity within herself.</p>
    <p>Hester moves into an abandoned cottage built on infertile soil at the edge of the colony. To earn a living, she sews garments for government officials, newborns, and funerals. She is never asked to sew for a wedding due to her prior affair.</p>
    <p>Every day, Hester wears only dull and basic garments, while she sews “fanciful” and “fantastic” dresses for her daughter to wear instead, which give her child an “airy charm”. Hester also sews for charity, with the hope of earning penance. However, sewing has become Hester's only means of expressing any, “taste for the gorgeously beautiful”.</p>
    <p>The scarlet letter is described as having an effect that is worse than the mark upon Cain in The Bible. Hester is ignored in town, the colony's women are blatently mean, church ministers regularly use her as an example of sin during services, and children taunt her during her walks. However, Hester never retorts and sees herself as a martyr instead. People also occasionally look upon the letter with sympathy – as though they have a secret sin of their own. This leads Hester to believe that the letter reveals people's true character, and shows her that she is not the only person to sin within Puritan society. Yet no matter the time of day, the letter always stands out with “red-hot with infernal fire, and could [always] be seen glowing…” To Hester, the brooch itself even seems to sear from her bodice.</p>

    <h2>Pearl</h2>
    <p>Hester named her child Pearl because the baby had symbolically come with a great price and was ‘purchased’ with all that Hester had. Hester also considers Pearl to be her only treasure.</p>
    <p>Every day, Hester anxiously watches Pearl become more wild, passionate, and dark in demeanor. Pearl often exhibits emotions which Hester strives to suppress within herself, and the child has an other-worldly ability to sense important details around her. She is also incapable of sorrow, is unadaptable, and will not conform to the rigid Puritan society around her. For all these reasons, the children of the Colony reject Pearl, and Pearl scorns the other children back while retaliating to their bullying and instigations whenever possible.</p>
    <p>Hester and Pearl are always with together due to their ostracization, and Pearl is always focused on mentioning the scarlet letter. This brings much torment and agony to Hester, but she also considers Pearl's behavior to be due penance for her sin.</p>
    <p>Compared to other Puritan families, Hester is noticeably less strict on Pearl, and Pearl is now spoken of as being a demon’s child who derived from Hester’s sin. Hester and her child are both seen a dishonor to the Puritan community. </p>

    <h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
          <div class = "mapSection">
          <img src="sectionPhotos/governorHouse.png" class = "map"/>
              According to a <a href="https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463705k" class="shadow" target="_blank">map</a> from 1641, Governor Richard Bellingham lived in a home that sat next to Bendell's Cove - which has since been drained, built over, and no longer exists. The Governor's home at this time would have been on or near 33 Union Street. 
          </div>
    <h2>The Governor’s Hall</h2>
    <p>Hester passes by the prison while on the way to the Governor’s mansion. She needs to deliver a pair of gloves and hopes speak with the Governor himself, to ask for the colony not remove Pearl from her care - which the town has recently been discussing. Unhappy with Hester's parenting, the colonists have gossiped about adopting Pearl into a more orthodox Puritan family, believing that Pearl’s soul was in jeopardy by living with Hester.</p>
    <p>Today, Pearl is dressed in a scarlet dress that is embroidered with endless gold details, transforming Pearl into a living embodiment of the scarlet letter. While on their way, children attempt to throw mud at them, which causes Pearl to chase the children off before returning to her mother with a wide smile.</p>
    <p>After arriving at the Governor's, Hester encounters an indentured servant who mistakes Hester's demeanor and scarlet letter as being signs of high rank, which allows Hester to barge into the mansion with no resistance. Once inside, Hester and Pearl find a rose bush while looking for the Governor. Pearl then begins asks Hester to pluck a blossom for her during their search, and begins to scream when Hester frefuses. Pearl does not stop her tantrum until the Governor finally appears.</p>

    <h2>The Elf-Child and the Minister</h2>
    <p>The Governor is with three guests: Reverend John Wilson, Minister Dimmesdale, and Hester's husband Chillingworth. Since moving to the colony, Chillingworth has befriended Dimmesdale, whose health has significantly declined since Hester's public punishment.</p>
    <p>After Hester asks the men to leave Pearl in her care, Reverend Wilson asks Pearl whether she is a Christian child, or somthing otherworldly, like the “superstitious creatures that were thought to have been left in England.” Pearl says she is Hester’s daughter.</p>
    <p>The men explain they were discussing the possibility of adopting Pearl to another family, causing Hester to assure them that she can raise Pearl herself through the shadow of the lessons gained from her scarlet letter. She explains that her experiences could potentially make Pearl wise. After hearing her justifications, the men then try to test Pearl’s knowledge of Puritan beliefs, and ask Pearl who had created her. Pearl responds in an otherworldly demeanor, saying that she was plucked from a wild rose bush that grew by the prison door – which she states simply because she saw the prison and rose bush while walking to the Governor's home. However, Chillingworth smiles as the Governor expresses his belief that Pearl’s soul is at risk due to this answer, and he believes that Pearl should be adopted.</p>
    <p>Determined, Hester grabs Pearl, declaring that God had given Pearl to her, and that Pearl unavoidably helps Hester earn retribution and ponder over her sins. She then begs Dimmesdale, who was once her Minister, to speak for her. He looks troubled and saddened by the scene.</p>
    <p>Dimmesdale explains that Pearl prevents Hester from further sin, and can create a form of repentance if raised well. Chillingworth comments on Dimmesdale’s attachment to the situation, then Pearl runs to Dimmesdale and places his hand against her cheek – which is a rare sign of affection from her. The men finally agree to leave Pearl in Hester’s care.</p>
    <p>As Hester leaves, Mistress Hibbins appears. She is the Governor’s sister who will later be accused of witchcraft. She invites Hester into the forest at night, stating that she promised to bring Hester to “the Black Man”.  Hester rejects the offer proudly and goes home with Pearl, knowing that Pearl is the reason she was not tempted to go to “Satan’s snare”.</p>

    <h2>The Leech</h2>
    <p>Chillingworth began attending Dimmesdale’s congregation soon after arriving at the colony. At the same time, Dimmesdale's health began to decline, seemingly from over-devotion to his job. The Minister was also known for his new habit of putting his hand over his heart whenever he was startled.</p>
    <p>Due to Minister Dimmesdale's vow of celibacy, the colony has not been abke to convince him to marry. However, the people around him do convince him to let Chillingworth medically treat him after concern develops over his fail state. The town also believes that Chillingworth has been sent from God to help Dimmesdale specifically.</p>
    <p>Soon after his treatments begin with Chillingworth, Dimmesdale allows the physician to move in with him. Both men then quickly take a keen interest in one another. Chillingworth specifically takes interest in Dimmesdale regularly hanging religious decor depicting Nathan the Prophet, as well as David and Bathsheba.</p>
    <p>Separately, Chillingworth had also changed into someone uglier and eviler since his arrival. The change has also become so pronounced that the town also wonders if Satan has come in disguise as a physician (Chiilingworth) to haunt the Minister and plot against him instead - rather treat him. The town watches the situation from afar, hoping that the Minister will overcome the situation. But Dimmesdale only looks sadder with each passing day instead.</p>

    <h2>The Leech and His Patient</h2>
    <p>Chillingworth was once a man of integrity who had sought the truth while making informed judgements. However, he now obsesses with digging into Dimmesdale’s conscious for secrets with no good intentions.</p>
    <p>To others, this unhealthy dynamic would be obvious, but Dimmesdale is unable to see past his depression, which causes him view all people the same and prevents him from examining Chillingworth as the enemy which he actually is.</p>
    <p>One day, the two roommates discuss the idea of people who die without confessing their secrets. These people are described as cowards who hide from their rightfully deserved shame, and hide their true, tarnished characters while falsely displaying a pure image to the public. During this discussion, they are interrupted by the sound of Pearl outside, and Hester soon appears after her. Eventually, all four notice one another, though Pearl ends the interaction by beckoning her mother away before the “Black Man” catches her, explaining in her otherworldly way that the "Black Man" has already caught the Minister.</p>
    <p>After Hester and Pearl leave, the two men reflect on how Hester wears her sin publicly, which makes her less miserable than someone who would carry their sins in private. This exchange causes Chillingworth to ask Dimmesdale if he has told him all his grievances, saying that his treatment will be compromised if he has undisclosed spiritual grievances instead. This causes Dimmesdale to sternly declare that he will not confess his sins to a physician who does not deal “medicine for the soul”. He also tells Chillingworth that he should not meddle in affairs which are between God and a sufferer.</p>
    <p>At a later time, Dimmesdale falls into a deep sleep while in his study, enabling Chillingworth to physicaly examine the Minister while he is unconscious. Chillingworth reveals that he has found something on Dimmesdale's chest, but does not describe what was discovered. Though Chillingworth acts excitedly and sinisterly from what he has found, to the point where he appears similar to Satan, and “a human soul that is lost to heaven, and won into his kingdom”.</p>

          </div>
    <h2>The Interior of a Heart</h2>
    <p>Chillingworth continually more grows more evil as he obsesses over revenge. Each day, he alters Dimmesdale’s wellbeing by instigating emotions of agony, fear, and any other feeling that creates emotional torment. Ironically, this torment makes Dimmesdale’s sermons more riveting to audiences, who relate to his eloquently conveyed sermons on pain and sin. It is also stated that if Dimmesdale was not so tormented from his own sins, then he would be considered saintly by Puritan beliefs. However, it is clear that Dimmesdale is suffering from serious guilt over his sins - to the point that his health is degrading.</p>
    <p>Secretly, Dimmesdale also harms himself, overly fasts, and constantly holds private vigils for himself throughout the night until he hallucinates of angels, demons, or his parents coming to haunt him. He also imagines Hester with Pearl, who points at her mother’s scarlet letter before the child then points toward his chest too.</p>
    <p>Dimmesdale holds a deep desire to confess his sin when preaching to his congregation – though he never does.</p>

            The scaffold was located at the market. According to a <a href="https://www.masshist.org/database/resource.php?t=MHS%20Collections%20Online%3A%20Map%20of%20the%20Town%20of%20Boston%201648%3B%20Drawn%20by%20Samuel%20C.%20Clough%2C%20in%20Accordance%20with%20Information%20Compiled%20from%20the%20Records%20of%20the%20Colony%20...&i=/database/images/5104_work/5104_work.xml&u=https%3A//www.masshist.org/database/viewer.php%3Fitem_id%3D1736%26mode%3Dzoomify%26img_step%3D1%26" class="shadow" target="_blank">map</a> from the 1640s, the market was located at the intersection of present-day State Street and Congress Street.
          </div>
    <h2>The Minister’s Vigil</h2>
    <p>Dimmesdale ascends the town’s scaffold late one night while the colony sleeps. He shrieks, thinking the town will awaken and find him on the scaffold. However, only two people appear before retreating without seeing him.</p>
    <p>Soon, Minister Wilson appears, returning home from assisting at a deathbed. Dimmesdale daydreams of announcing his presence, but remains quiet and surprised by his own instincts to reveal that he is standing on the scaffold. As he grows colder from the night and more paranoid, Hester then appears with Pearl after also coming from the deathbed to take measurements for funeral robes.</p>
    <p>Dimmesdale now reveals himself and beckons Hester and Pearl to join him on the scaffold. Once together, he takes Pearl’s hand and feels a rush of joy. However, Pearl asks if he will stand with her and her mother tomorrow during the day, on the same scaffold, in front of the town. He refuses, which leads Pearl to try and remove her hand – though he refuses to let go. Pearl then repeats her question, and he says he will stand with them on “the great judgement day”. A meteor then crosses the sky, creating a dull red letter "A" in the sky.</p>
    <p>Together on the scaffold, with Dimmesdale holding his chest and Hester wearing her letter, as well as Pearl between them, Pearl begins to point in the distance at Chillingworth, who is watching them. This scares Dimmesdale, who asks Hester if she knows the man. Rather than answer, Pearl interjects and lectures him, saying he is not “bold” or “true”.</p>
    <p>As this happens, Chillingworth nears and rexplains that he was also returning from the deathbed as an attending physician. He encourages Dimmesdale to return home with him, and Dimmesdale agrees and descends from the scaffold.</p>
    <p>The next day, Dimmesdale gives a passionate sermon. Though after the service finishes, a man returns Dimmesdale's glove to him, saying that he found it on the scaffold - though the man believes the glove was left by Satan, and not by Dimmesdale.</p>

    <h2>Another View of Hester</h2>
    <p>After 7 years, Hester is shocked by how emotionally and physically destroyed Dimmesdale had appeared on the scaffold, even though he is still intellectually sharp and creates gripping sermons. She now feels a responsibility to help him.</p>
    <p>Over time, Hester’s charity has led the Puritans to sympathize for her, and colonists now say that the scarlet letter represents “Able” instead of “Adulterer”. However, Hester doesn’t feel that she deserves the growing kindness.</p>
    <p>The letter had also withered away what was left of Hester’s old personality: her hair now hides in a cap, she wears plain clothing, and her confidence has changed into humility. Meanwhile, Pearl has continually grown stranger by the day in her own otherworldly way. For years, Hester regularly wondered whether Pearl was supposed to exist, and wondered the same for womenkind in general. She pondered over what would be needed to finally allow women to be equal to men in society, and found herself experiencing suicidal urges. However, after the night on the scaffold with Dimmesdale, she now feels new purpose in rescuing Dimmesdale from Chillingworth - her European husband, who clearly knows that Dimmesdale is the father of her child.</p>
    <p>Hester also grows angry with herself, realizing she condemned Dimmesdale to torment by not revealing Chillingworth's true identity. However, she acknowledges that she no longer feels obligated to uphold her promise to hide her husband's true identity, thanks to her achieved growth over the years, while Dimmesdale has only fallen in demise.</p>

    <h2>Hester and the Physician.</h2>
    <p>Hester sees the Chillingworth foraging for herbs and asks Pearl to play nearby while she speaks him. He is no longer calm or quiet, but fierce, eager, and guarded with a searing gaze - becoming an example of someone turning themselves into the devil.</p>
    <p>Hester explains her intention to break her promise due to her duty for Dimmesdale, and to end the anguish that Chillingworth is clearly putting him through. However, Chillingworth gaslights Hester instead and claims that he does not know what she mean. He then asks for more specific examples. He also states that he is treating the Minister as any physician would, and adds that Dimmesdale lacks the strength which Hester has.</p>
    <p>After Chillingworth says that his treatments are the only reason that Dimmesdale is alive, Hester responds that it would have been better for Dimmesdale to die rather than suffer and believe that her husband's torment is God-given instead of being the actions of a worst enemy. She also tells Chillgworth that he had once been human, but has now become a fiend.</p>
    <p>Chillingworth takes a second to comprehend his new characterization and reputation, then responds that the torment will not only continue, but grow. Hester then blames herself for everyone's pain, and asks why he will not torment her instead. Though he answers that the scarlet letter is avenging his pain already.</p>
    <p>After stating that she will tell the truth to Dimmesdale, Chillingworth says that he does not care, and foreshadows that their destinies are set, adding that all the good within her has been wasted due to this inevitable destiny. Hester then retorts that his traits have also been wasted as well, since he has become so evil.</p>

    <h2>Hester and Pearl</h2>
    <p>It is noted that sunlight never falls on Chillingworth, who travels with a seemingly unavoidable shadow.</p>
    <p>Hester also now finally acknowledges her hatred for Chillingworth and feels disgust that they ever married, deeming their marriage to be her worst crime. She despises that he convinced her that they could ever be happy together, and says his actions have been a true betrayal. She also believes that his sins are worse than her affair – which resulted from finding love, rather than occurring from hate. She also wonders if she has accumulated penance after seven years of wearing the scarlet letter.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Pearl is playing nearby and has taken some seaweed from the ocean to fashion it into a letter "A" on her own chest. Pearl wants to understand the scarlet letter's significance, which is still unknown to her.</p>
    <p>Hester sees the seaweed letter on her daughter's chest and asks Pearl if she knows why her mother must wear the scarlet letter. Pearl responds, in her otherworldly way, that it is the same reason the Minister keeps his hand on his chest.</p>
    <p>For a second, Hester wants to tell Pearl everything and finally have someone to confide in. Though she decides not to, realizing that Pearl must experience sorrow in a different way to develop empathy. Instead, she tells Pearl that she wears the scarlet letter for the gold thread details. It is the first time she has ever lied about why she wears the scarlet letter, though Pearl doesn’t believe the answer and continues to endlessly ask about its significance well into the next morning.</p>

    <h2>A Forest Walk</h2>
    <p>Hester begins regularly walking in the forest, in hopes of running into Dimmesdale to warn him about Chillingworth. Rather than visiting Dimmesdale at his study, Hester wants to ensure they will be alone to avoid interruptions and have the opportunity to be themselves without others watching. Today, she knows Dimmesdale will be returning home after visiting to local group of Native converts.</p>
    <p>As Pearl and Hester walk, the forest grows cold and somber. Occasionally, the sun appears - though never near Hester. Pearl notices and says that the sunlight is avoiding Hester's scarlet letter. To help, Pearl tries to catch the sunlight to share it with her mother, believing that that the light will then stay for her mother because Pearl does not wear a letter.</p>
    <p>As Pearl begins to play in the sun and seemingly catches the light, Hester tries to join. But the sun vanishes whenever Hester nears.</p>
    <p>After giving up. Hester then watches her daughter and reflects on Pearl's inability to feel sorrow, which has prevented her from developing or showing sympathy for any other people or sad situations. However, Hester knows that Pearl still has time to experience sorrow and develop this capability.</p>
    <p>While waiting, Pearl asks to hear a story which she heard from Mistress Hibbins, about an “ugly black man” who offers a book and iron pen in the forest. Pearl says that people sign the book in blood and then receive his mark on their chest, which glows flamelike as people return to him at midnight. In response, Hester says she has met the man, and the scarlet letter is his mark.</p>
    <p>As they speak, the forest becomes gloomy, which frustrates Pearl, who thinks the forest should be cheery. However, the Minister soon appears with his hand over his chest, and Hester asks Pearl to go play nearby and only return when called back. Before leaving, Pearl asks her mom if the Minister has the mark on his chest but does not show it. Avoiding the question, Hester tells her child to run and play instead.</p>

    <h2>The Pastor and His Parishioner</h2>
    <p>Hester beckons Dimmesdale into the forest, where they ask one another if they are at peace. Dimmesdale explains that he is not, due to guilt from his religious beliefs. Hester retorts that everyone admires him, though he says this only brings him more misery. Believing that Dimmesdale has already repented, Hester says that his current life is just as holy as it was before their affair. However Dimmesdale responds that he regrets not leaving his position or revealing himself to be Pearl’s father. He also voices that his belief that Hester was fortunate in having her sin known through the scarlet letter, rather than have it burn in secret. Dimmesdale then states that he wished someone else knew of his secret to minimize his feelings of hypocrisy, which causes Hester to reveal that Chillingworth already knows. She then reveals his identity to Dimmesdale.</p>
    <p>Hester feels guilt knowing that Chillingworth used his title as a physician to torment Dimmesdale – whom she still loves. She even prefers death over explaining her part in the farce, and begs for forgiveness after revealing the truth. Though Dimmesdale refuses to forgive her, and grows angry with himself, knowing that he should have recognized the physician’s true intentions.</p>
    <p>Hester suddently dreads seeing Dimmesdale's face in a frown, since he was the only person who had never frowned at her. Hester continues to ask for forgiveness, and he soon calms down and forgives her, stating that they are not the worst sinners in the world and that Chillingworth had sinned worse than they had. Hester then assures Dimmesdale that Chillingworth will not reveal their secret, but adds that Dimmesdale must stop residing with him. In response, Dimmesdale acts helpless and says that he can’t leave, causing Hester to tell him that he must grow stronger.</p>
    <p>As Dimmesdale begs Hester for a solution, she states that they should run away together. However Dimmesdale says that it is his destiny to remain in the colony. Hester insists this is not true, and says that he can be the person he was born to be, rather than the person he had become since their affair. Suddenly, the Minister feels hope, and begins to agree to her idea with enthusiasm.</p>

    <h2>18.	A Flood of Sunshine</h2>
    <p>Dimmesdale feels a mix of fear, joy, and admiration towards Hester for saying what he secretly desires but won’t allow himself to even think. He analyzes how her seclusion has allowed her to become independent and unafraid of the community’s standards, while he has been stuck in the middle of every Puritan norm, prejudice, and regulation that is demanded from a Minister. He also reflects on how guilt can damage the soul of a person beyond repair.</p>
    <p>However, for the first time in seven years, Dimmesdale now feels hope and freedom. He also acknowledges that he wants to spend his life with Hester, who he compares to an angel.</p>
    <p>To signal and prove that the past is behind them, Hester now pulls off the scarlet letter, throws it away, lets down her hair, and feels her youth, appeal, and confidence return. The sun then finally shines of her, and the forest changes from somber to cheerful.</p>
    <p>In excitement, Hester begins to call over Pearl to introduce her to the Minister, her father, for the first time. The Minister instantly becomes nervous of this, and warns Hester that children don’t usually enjoy his company. However, Hester assures him that everything will work out, and continues to beckon Pearl who is playing in the sunlight – looking otherworldly.</p>

    <h2>The Child at the Brook-Side</h2>
    <p>Hester beckons Pearl as Dimmesdale reflects on the only two moments he interacted with her – at the Governor’s mansion when she showed him affection, and the night on the scaffold.</p>
    <p>When Pearl nears, she refuses to cross the brook separating them, emitting an otherworldly peculiarity that injects fear into the situation. As she stares and wonders what their relation to one another is, Dimmesdale watches Pearl look between him and his hand on his chest. Pearl then raises her hand to point at her mother’s chest with a frightening frown and starts stomping in place, Hester then grows stern, resulting in Pearl having a shrieking temper tantrum all while she continues to point at her mother’s chest. Hester then quickly realizes that the missing scarlet letter is the cause, and the Minister asks Hester to end the tantrum by any means necessary.</p>
    <p>Hester sighs and asks Pearl to bring the scarlet letter that she had torn off to her, but Pearl demands that Hester pick it up herself. Hester obliges while seeing the request as penance, but daydreams of throwing the letter into the ocean. Hester also feels doomed while placing it back on – as though she has reassumed her destiny of penance.</p>
    <p>As Hester hides her hair, her youth and joy also dissipate, along with the sun that briefly shined on her. Pearl then crosses the brook, saying that Hester is now the mother she knows, and gives a rare affectionate kiss to her mother before kissing the scarlet letter as well. Hester then berates Pearl for this cruel gesture, but Pearl ignores her and asks why the Minister is there.</p>
    <p>Hester asks Pearl to show Dimmesdale affection, but Pearl asks if he will love them back and return to town with them. Hester says that they will not return together, but adds that they will in the future. Hester also says that she loves the Minister and hopes that Pearl will love him too. Pearl then asks if he will always hold his hand on his chest, which further irritates Hester. Unknowningly to both Hester and Pearl, this is Pearl's first time experiencing jealousy, since she has never had to share her mother's affection or attention before.</p>
    <p>The Minister finally tries to kiss Pearl, though Pearl rejects the gesture and runs to the brook to wash away the kiss. After, she doesn’t return and watches Hester and Dimmesdale from a distance.</p>

    <h2>The Minister in a Maze</h2>
    <p>Hester, Pearl, and Dimmesdale return to the colony - though not together.</p>
    <p>Back in the forest, Dimmesdale and Hester had agreed to move to a European city, since he was not strong enough for a rural lifestyle and was more comfortable in developed cities with societal norms and standards. They agree to leave by ship, and Hester plans to speak with a captain she is acquainted with from her charity work to help them escape from the colony. They will leave in 4 days, after Dimmesdale delivers a final sermon on Election Day. Dimmesdale is happy that he will be remembered for finishing his duties appropriately before fleeing.</p>
    <p>Dimmesdale walks noticeably more energetic, and feels that he is looking at life through new eyes. However, he also begins feeling impulses to commit sinful acts against people around him. He fears these new impulses, but also finds an odd humor within them. This causes him to wonder if they come from unknowingly agreeing to a wicked oath while in the forest.</p>
    <p>Mistress Hibbins now nears and remarks on his visit in the forest, though Dimmesdale insists that he went with Puritan intentions. However, she ignores this response and says that they will meet in the forest together at midnight. After she leaves, Dimmesdale questions if he has “sold” himself to the devil, and grows angry at himself for being tempted by happiness when he knew his soul was tainted by the “poison” of sin.</p>
    <p>At home, Chillingworth arrives and offers his medical services in preparation for the Election Sermon, though Dimmesdale rejects the offer and says he will no longer need any medical assistance – knowing that Chillingworth is actually his “bitterest enemy”. Chillingworth insists on services, saying that Dimmesdale may not live past another year. Though Dimmesdale replies that his death would only lead into another - hopefully better - world.</p>
    <p>After Chillingworth leaves, Dimmesdale vivaciously begins to write a new sermon after throwing his already-completed version into the fire. </p>

    <h2>The New England Holiday</h2>
    <p>Hester and Pearl arrive at the market on Election Day, and Hester feels and extra sense of both celebration and guilt, since this will be the last time anyone will see the scarlet letter or view her as a lifelong victim of its sentence.</p>
    <p>Pearl is also very excited, to the point that she almost emulates the hidden emotions which Hester is trying to hide. Pearl asks and learns about the celebration being permitted by the Puritan colony for Election Day, and oddly remarks that the ugly black man should not nod at her if he attends. However, Pearl says that the black man may nod at Hester, because she wears the scarlet letter and grey clothing.</p>
    <p>Hester explains that a procession with the Minister will occur, causing Pearl to ask if he will reach out for them as he passes by. Hester says that he will not, and adds that Pearl should not greet him either. Pearl then calls Dimmesdale “a strange, sad man” who will only hold them, love them, and beckon them at night or in a forest, but ignores them during the day while expecting them to do the same back. This causes Hester to try and end the conversation, and she tells Pearl that she does not understand how things are.</p>
    <p>As they wait, the crowd is described as only slightly less somber than usual. The celebrations include no music, entertainment, or singing due to the disciplines and laws of the colony, which are described as being enabled solely due to the mutual sentiment felt within the community to uphold Puritan values. However, within the crowd, visiting sailors are celebrating more liberally by committing acts normally forbidden to Puritans, such as drinking from flasks and smoking tobacco.</p>
    <p>Hester soon sees the captain she had already spoken with - and he is currently speaking to Chillingworth. After the two men separate, the captain walks to Hester and states that the ship will be free of outbreaks thanks to a physician who will join: Chillingworth, who claimed to be traveling within Hester’s party and claimed to be close friend of Dimmesdale’s. Chillingworth smiles at Hester from a distance while the captain reveals this information.</p>

          <div class = "mapSection">
          <img src="sectionPhotos/churchAndScaffold.png" class = "map"/>
            The scaffold was located at the market. According to a <a href="https://www.masshist.org/database/resource.php?t=MHS%20Collections%20Online%3A%20Map%20of%20the%20Town%20of%20Boston%201648%3B%20Drawn%20by%20Samuel%20C.%20Clough%2C%20in%20Accordance%20with%20Information%20Compiled%20from%20the%20Records%20of%20the%20Colony%20...&i=/database/images/5104_work/5104_work.xml&u=https%3A//www.masshist.org/database/viewer.php%3Fitem_id%3D1736%26mode%3Dzoomify%26img_step%3D1%26" class="shadow" target="_blank">map</a> from the 1640s, the market was located at the intersection of present-day State Street and Congress Street. The church, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Church_in_Boston" class="shadow" target="_blank">opened</a> its location within the colony in 1639, was facing the market. Today, the church has been replaced with the One Boston Place skyscraper, on the west side of Washington Street. 
              </div>
    <h2>The Procession</h2>
    <p>Before Hester can evaluate the new information given by the captain, the procession music begins and the local leaders pass by - including the Minister, who is noticeably energetic. Hester’s mood then begins to change as he passes by her without even one glance. Even though they felt close to one another in the forest, he now seems distant, proud, and unattainable. She even believes that their bond is not real, and feels incapable of forgiving him for the distance she now feels.</p>
    <p>After he passes by, Pearl asks if he is the same man who kissed her in the forest. Hester says to not speak about this publicly, but Pearl continues and says that he looked different from who he was in the forest. Pearl also says that she would have asked him for a kiss if he did not look so different now, then asks Hester what the Minister would have done if she asked for a kiss. Hester replies that it was not an appropriate time to ask for a kiss.</p>
    <p>Mistress Hibbins now runs into Hester, and states that the Minister is no longer the same man who left the forest with her. Hester denies meeting Dimmesdale in the forest, though Hibbins ignores the remark and says that Hester wears her mark openly while the Minister hides his. Hibbins also foretells that Dimmesdale’s bond to his "mark" will force him to reveal his true self to the public. Pearl takes interest in this conversation, and Hibbins then tells Pearl that she will see the mark soon.</p>
    <p>As everyone settles to hear Dimmesdale’s sermon within a church, Hester stands next to the scaffold to listen from the outside. She is moved by the sermon, which is inspired by feelings of complaint, guilt, sorrow, the desire to tell a secret, and beseeching for sympathy and forgiveness. As Hester listens, Pearl runs around the market and encounters a sailor who asks her to give a message to her mother: that the accompanying physician has told the crew he will board the ship with Dimmesdale himself, so Hester should only worry about boarding with Pearl. Pearl relays the message, which dampens Hester's sprits and forces her to notice that everyone around her who is not from the colony seems to be looking directly at her scarlet letter rudely. Hester suddently sees that Dimmesdale is viewed as saintly from his pillared within the church, while Hester wears her scarlet letter next to the scaffold outdside. Ironically, no one would fathom that they were both involved in the affair.</p>

    <h1>Chapter Twenty-three</h1>
          <div class = "mapSection">
          <img src="sectionPhotos/scaffold.png" class = "map"/>
            The scaffold was located at the market. According to a <a href="https://www.masshist.org/database/resource.php?t=MHS%20Collections%20Online%3A%20Map%20of%20the%20Town%20of%20Boston%201648%3B%20Drawn%20by%20Samuel%20C.%20Clough%2C%20in%20Accordance%20with%20Information%20Compiled%20from%20the%20Records%20of%20the%20Colony%20...&i=/database/images/5104_work/5104_work.xml&u=https%3A//www.masshist.org/database/viewer.php%3Fitem_id%3D1736%26mode%3Dzoomify%26img_step%3D1%26" class="shadow" target="_blank">map</a> from the 1640s, the market was located at the intersection of present-day State Street and Congress Street.

    <h2>The Revelation of the Scarlet Letter</h2>
    <p>The crowd returns outside while expressing admiration for the service, which is describe as including Dimmesdale's best sermon yet. The crowd attributes the speech to his short time remaining to live.</p>
    <p>The Minister now emerges, clearly in his life’s proudest moment. Hester, meanwhile, is alone by the scaffold – feeling the scarlet letter burn against her chest.</p>
    <p>The music for the procession starts again to escort the leaders to a banquet, and the crowd continues to admire Dimmesdale, however his disposition suddenly looks deathlike. Minister Wilson notices and offers help, though Dimmesdale insists on walking alone with a weak gait.</p>
    <p>When he nears the scaffold and sees Hester, the scarlet letter, and Pearl, he stops and pauses before leaving the procession to walk to the scaffold. There, he weakly beckons for Hester and Pearl to join with underlying triumph. As they unite, Chillingworth emerges and grabs Dimmesdale, telling him to cast Hester and Pearl away to preserve his reputation, though Dimmesdale tells him that he is too late, and that he is ready to end Chillingworth’s torment.</p>
    <p>Dimmesdale asks Hester to help support him up the scaffold's stairs, and the crowd watches silently with shock as Dimmesdale ascends and begins to admit his secret to the crowd. While confessing, he takes a brief pause and asks Hester if this is better than what they had dreamed in the forest, to which she replies that she does not know. Dimmesdale then finishes his public confession with Hester and Pearl nearby. He praises Hester, and says that everyone has a scarlet letter of their own even though theirs is hidden. He adds that the devil had helped to hide his sin, which allowed him to walk in praise. He then tears off his ministerial band, opens his shirt, and reveals his chest in triumph while the physician falls beside him in defeat. Dimmesdale then asks Pearl for a kiss, who is suddenly overcome with grief for the first time in her life. She walks over and kisses him on the cheek. Pearl’s emotions anguishing over the situation is also described readers as when her mother's penance over the scarlet letter will finally end.</p>
    <p>Dimmesdale then falls after confessing, says goodbye to Hester, and tells her to focus on their mutual sin instead of pondering if they will meet again in the afterlife - believing that it was vain hope for them to believe they would meet in an “everlasting and pure reunion”. He gives a final praise for God's will, which he says is now finished, then dies on the scaffold.</p>

    <h1>Chapter Twenty-four</h1>
          <div class = "mapSection">
      <img src="sectionPhotos/cottage.png" class = "map"/>
          Hester's fictional cottage is described being on the west side of the colony, away from all residential properties. It sits on the coast and stares at the western-facing hills. Based on this description, and using a <a href="https://www.masshist.org/database/resource.php?t=MHS%20Collections%20Online%3A%20Map%20of%20the%20Town%20of%20Boston%201648%3B%20Drawn%20by%20Samuel%20C.%20Clough%2C%20in%20Accordance%20with%20Information%20Compiled%20from%20the%20Records%20of%20the%20Colony%20...&i=/database/images/5104_work/5104_work.xml&u=https%3A//www.masshist.org/database/viewer.php%3Fitem_id%3D1736%26mode%3Dzoomify%26img_step%3D1%26" class="shadow" target="_blank">map</a> from the 1640's which showed forrested terrain, the area where the fictional cottage would likely have been is highlighted in green.
          </div>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The story never reveals what was on Dimmesdale’s chest. Some say it was a letter "A" imprinted from self-mutilation, others claim the physician caused it to appear through self anguish, and some even say that the mark appeared from Dimmesdale’s own guilt. Others also deny that any mark existed at all.</p>
    <p>The town believes that Dimmesdale had made his death a final parable, to show how all people are sinners alike. Though, Dimmesdale’s story is described as actually revealing the stubborn characteristic of people to uphold certain people's character - even after they are proven to be false. However, it is revealed that the most important lesson to gain from the novel is “Be true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred!”</p>
    <p>It is described that after losing his life’s purpose - to seek revenge - Chillingworth died just one year later, and had left a large amount of property to Pearl. This then made Pearl one of the richest heiresses of the colonies at the time, and instantly changed Pearl’s status within Puritan society. Hester and Pearl then left New England, and the scarlet letter grew to be known as a legend. Yet years later, Hester returned to her cottage without Pearl, and began to wear the scarlet letter again.</p>
    <p>In the cottage, Hester surrounded herself with expensive items that she never used, and sewed baby’s clothing for what was assumed to be Pearl’s own family. Pearl would have happily allowed Hester to live with her, though Hester chose to return to New England instead - where her sin, sorrow, and penitence remained even though the scarlet letter had lost its stigma and was now converted into a symbol that elicited sorrow, awe, and even reverence among the colonists.</p>
    <p>Before passing away, Hester became sure that future men and women would reach a new level of mutual happiness, and her character was described as being buried in King Chapel, next to Dimmesdale. They each lay in separate graves, but share a single engraved headstone:</p>

    <div class = "graveDescription">
    “sable” = pitch black<br>
    “gules” = red<br><br>
    The description on the tombstone portrays a somber, pitch black background that is contrasted by a red glow. On the surface, it looks like Hester and Dimmesdale are buried with their sin, however it instead symbolizes that Hester and the Minister are buried together, under the scarlet letter as equals. The symbol represents them each in their own way.
