           20 years after the Mayflower landed, during the early Colonial Era in the US, the Puritans collectively inhabited what is presently known as Boston, Massachusetts.</div>
            <div class = "introduction">This is the setting for The Scarlet Letter - a story which was heavily influenced by Nathaniel's own upbringing in New England, and his family's ties to religous Puritans.</div>
            <div class = "introduction">His great-great-great grandfather, <a href="https://historyofmassachusetts.org/john-hathorne-the-salem-witch-judge/">William Hathorne</a>, was a Puritan who immigrated from England to Massachusets in the 1630s, and his great-great grandfather, <a href="https://historyofmassachusetts.org/john-hathorne-the-salem-witch-judge/">John Hathorne</a>, presided as a ruthless judge over the religious persecution of local residents in the Salem Witch Trials - which enabled him to acquire their assets afterwards, and was known for administering cruely harsh judgements to Essex County residents and Quakers in particular.

        <div class = "introduction">Who were the Puritans?</div>

        <div class = "introduction">For over a millennium, Catholicism was a major religion throughout Europe. However, in 1517, Martin Luther nailed a list of objections to Catholic beliefs on a church door in Germany, marking the rise of Protestants.</div>

        <div class = "introduction">Protestantism was a new branch of Christianity which sought to separate from Catholicism and practice religion in its own way. Its philosophies spread quickly, along with a decimating Intolerance from all sides – such as King Henry VIII (1491-1547) - who persecuted Catholics, and Queen Mary I – his daughter, who then persecuted Protestants so terribly that she earned the nickname Bloody Mary.</div>

        <div class = "introduction">As Protests grew, so did Puritans – who believed that Protestantism was too lenient.</div>

        <div class = "introduction">Facing prosecution in Europe, hundreds of Puritans left to establish new communities in Massachusetts Bay Colony (1630) and a separate sect went to Plymouth Colony (1620) - whose inhabitants were taught to survive by the Natives from the area.</div>

        <div class = "introduction">Both colonies were governed by orthodox religious principles, with rigid laws and severe punishments. Similar to other religious Europeans at the time, Puritans were intolerant of religious differences or diversity, and became cruel and unjust to the Native communities that once saved their first Colonial settlers.</div>

        <div class = "introduction">One philosophy central to Puritanism is the belief that people were pre-ordained for salvation or damnation. Due to this, everyone was seen as immanently wicked and destined for damnation, or was pre-destined for salvation by demonstrating Puritan Grace. Sins committed were seen as reflective of a destiny for damnation – and were considered both irreversible and unforgivable.</div>

        <div class = "introduction">This belief heavily dictates the interactions that occur within The Scarlet Letter.</div>
