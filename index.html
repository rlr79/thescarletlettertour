                <div class = "introductionWords">For over a millennium, Catholicism was a major European religion. However, in 1517, Martin Luther nailed a list of objections to Catholic doctione onto a church door - officially marking the rise of Protestants.</div>

                <div class = "introductionWords">Protestantism was a new branch of Christianity. It spread quickly, along with a violent intolerance on all sides – such as King Henry VIII (1491-1547), who cruely persecuted Catholics, followed by Queen Mary I (1516-1558), his daughter, who persecuted Protestants until she earned the nickname "Bloody Mary".</div>

                <div class = "introductionWords">As Protestants grew, so did the Puritans – who believed that Protestantism was too lenient.</div>

                <div class = "introductionWords">To avoid persecution, hundreds of Puritans established new communities in Massachusetts Bay Colony (1630), and Plymouth Colony (1620) - whose settlers only survived after the local Natives helped them to adapt.</div>

                <div class = "introductionWords">Puritan colonies were governed by ultra-orthodox religious principles, rigid laws, and severe punishments. Similar to other religious Europeans of the time, Puritan leaders were also intolerant of differences, and became cruel to the Native communities around them.</div>

                <div class = "introductionWords">Within Puritan society, a belief existed that each person was pre-destined for either salvation or damnation before birth. Thus, sins were considered irreversible and unforgivable, and those who sinned were seen as unavoidably wicked, while those who lived in Puritan Grace were seen as pre-ordained for salvation.</div>

                <div class = "introductionWords">This belief heavily dictates the interactions which occur within The Scarlet Letter.</div>

    <h1>Chapter One</h1>
    <h2>The Prison Door</h2>
    <p>The novel begins by examining the irony within the colony’s layout. </p>
    <p>Even though it was created with Puritan ideals, it included a prison and cemetery, revealing that the first Puritans ultimately knew that establishing a Christian "utopia" was not possible.</p>
    <p>The prison itself has an ominous, spiked wooden door, with a wild rose bush growing just outside of it – symbolically showing that nature shares pity and kindness more indiscriminatly then humankind.</p>
    <p>One the setting is described, the author then states that the just-mentioned roses will relieve readers of the frailty and sorrow within the oncoming story, just as they comfort prisoners who walk through the prison door.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section data-name="Ch. 2">
    <h1>Chapter Two</h1>
    <h2>The Market-Place</h2>
    <p>The story begins with a gathering crowd that came to witness a public punishment.</p>
    <p>The colony's punishments are decided both legally and religiously – though the difference is minute. Examples include expelling people with religious differences, Natives who become drunk, and persecuting people for witchcraft. </p>
    <p>At present, the Puritan women are focus on the accused: a woman named Hester Prynne. The women believe their local Minister, Reverend Dimmesdale, is especially aggrieved by her, since she was his congregant, and that her crime had tarnished the community. Unable to attain a death sentence, the women discuss branding Hester’s forehead, saying that whatever item she must wear for the crime will easily be covered.</p>
    <p>Soon, Hester herself determinedly exits from the prison, ascends the town’s scaffold, and holds a baby over her chest, clearly hiding something. Though Hester quickly accepts that she cannot hide either the baby or the item on her bodice, which is an elaborately embroidered letter ‘A’ made from scarlet red cloth and gold thread, which stands for "adulterer". Hester is condemned to wear this scarlet letter for the rest of her life, and can immediately feels the letter secluding her from society.</p>
    <p>Soon, the women return to discussion, angry with how beautifully Hester had embroidered the scarlet letter - seeing it as a mockery. They discuss their wish to rip off the letter and her gown to replace them with more unsightly alternatives.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Hester is described as resembling Mother Mary with Baby Jesus. However, the crowd sternly glares instead, which Hester finds to be nearly unbearable, preferring mockery. To escape, she relives her memories, including her marriage to a European scholar, who had a physical anomaly where one shoulder sat noticably higher than the other. After marrying, Hester came to New England alone, and found her way into her present situation – which she is just starting to accept.</p>

  <section data-name="Ch. 3">
    <h1>Chapter Three</h1>
    <h2>The Recognition</h2>
    <p>At the edge of the crowd, Hester sees a Native man and European with the same shoulder anomaly as her husband. Hester quickly realizes that her husband has arrived, and he slowly sees that Hester, his wife, is being punished. He presses his finger to his lips and signals for her to not reveal his presence, then asks a spectator about what is happening.</p>
    <p>After explaining his arrival and subsequent imprisonment within a Native tribe, the spectator welcomes the husband back to European society, where “sin is searched out, and punished”, and explains that Hester came from Amsterdam two years ago, but her husband never followed. Now, she has had a baby with someone else and will not name the father. The husband feels frustrated with himself for not expecting this result after a two-year delay in following Hester, and learns that she must now stand on the scaffold for 3 hours, before wearing the scarlet letter for the rest of her life. The spectator also notes how unfair it is for Hester to be punished alone, though believes the father will be found.</p>
    <p>During this exchange, Hester reflects on how it better for her affair to be discovered by him in such a public way, rather than in private, while the local leaders, including the Governor, Minister John Wilson, and Minister Arthur Dimmesdale begin to speak.</p>
    <p>Minister Wilson states that he pleaded for Minister Dimmesdale to force Hester to name the father, for the sake of her soul, to demonstrate repentance, and for Dimmesdale to uphold his responsibilities as her Minister. In response, Dimmesdale - who was formally educated in Europe, and is young, well-spoken, and viewed as pure - asks Hester to name the father, arguing that he does not deserve pity, and it would reveal his hypocrisy along with his sin. However, Hester still refuses - even when Wilson offers to remove the scarlet letter in exchange. Hester then says her child will have a “heavenly father”, instead of a physical one.</p>
    <p>Dimmesdale remarks on her generosity, puts his hand over his heart, and retreats, while the other leaders begin hours of lectures on sin, using comparisons to the scarlet letter until everyone imagines it as "flaming" and “infernal”. Hester's baby cries during the entire event.</p>

  <section data-name="Ch. 4">
    <h1>Chapter Four</h1>
    <h2>The Interview</h2>
    <p>In prison, Hester has an emotional breakdown, and medical help is sought when it is apparent that Hester’s baby is also experiencing pain. A physician named Roger Chillingworth is brought, however it is Hester’s European husband in disguise.</p>
    <p>Alone toghether, Hester mistrusts him – fearing that he will poison her baby. Though, Chillingworth insists he will not, and gives a drought which helps the baby sleep. He then makes another for Hester while staring at her coldly. Still mistrustful, Hester says she does not want to drink poison either, though he responds that he would rather suffer her to live with the scarlet letter.</p>
    <p>Chillingworth toments Hester while together by frequently touching and mentioning the letter. He then expresses his self-anger for thinking that she could be happy with someone anti-social, older, and physically different as he was, and adds that he hoped for his intellect to maintain her loyalty and attraction. Hester then counters that she always said she was not in love with him. However, Chillingworth stubbornly responds that he imagined his wish to find love through her could inspire her to love him back. Feeling guilt, Hester says she betrayed him, though Chillingworth says they have betrayed each other, then explains he doesn’t want vengeance from her, but from the father instead.</p>
    <p>When Hester refuses to name the father, the husband coldly oaths to find him. Once found, rather than identify or kill him, Chillingworth wants hthe father to live so he can punish the man himself.</p>
    <p>Before leaving, Chillingworth makes Hester promise to not tell anyone about their relationship, preferring to assume his new identity, to let the town believe that Hester’s husband is permanently gone, and to avoid sharing the dishonor of her affair. Hester promises, saying she will keep his secret just as she hides the father's. This causes Chillingworth to smile hideously, making Hester question the intention of the promise – though he assures her that the promise will not specifically hurt her.</p>

  <section data-name="Ch. 5">
    <h1>Chapter Five</h1>
    <h2>Hester at Her Needle</h2>
    <p>Hester knows the scarlet letter will bring new challenges, and she will be seen as embodying “women’s frailty and sinful passion", as well as the sin of adultery. However, she remains in New England for various reasons. She feels rooted and reborn from her sentenceing, so much that her old life now feels foreign to her. Hester is also still in love with her baby's father - who lives nearby - and she tells herself that remaining not only builds penance, but develops a new “saint-like” purity within her.</p>
    <p>Hester moves into an abandoned cottage built on infertile soil on the edge of the colony. To earn a living, she sews garments for government officials, newborns, and funerals. Though, she is never asked to sew for a wedding due to her prior affair.</p>
    <p>Every day, Hester is described as wearing dull, basic garments, yet she sews “fanciful” and “fantastic” dresses for her daughter, which give the child a more “airy charm”. She also sews for charity, with the hope of earning penance. However, sewing has become Hester's only means of expressesing any “taste for the gorgeously beautiful”.</p>
    <p>The scarlet letter is described as having a worse effect than the mark upon Cain within The Bible. Hester is ignored in town, women treat her meanly, church ministers use her as an example during services, and children taunt her during walks. However, Hester never retorts, and sees herself as a martyr. Though, people occasionally look upon the letter with sympathy – as though they had a sin of their own - leading Hester believe that the letter reveales the people's true hearts, and shows that she is not the only person to sin within Puritan society. However, no matter the time of day, the letter always stands out with “red-hot with infernal fire, and could [always] be seen glowing…” To Hester, the brooch also seems to sear from her bodice.</p>

    <h1>Chapter Six</h1>
    <h2>Pearl</h2>
    <p>Hester named her child Pearl since she symblicaly came with a great price, which was ‘purchased’ with all that Hester had. Hester also considers Pearl to be her only tresure.</p>
    <p>Every day, Hester worriedly watches Pearl become more wild, passionate, and dark in demeanor. She often exhibits emotions which Hester strives to supress within herself, and has an other-worldly ability to sense important details around her. She is also incapable of sorrow, and is unadaptable to the rigid Puritan society around her. For all these reasons, the children of the Colony reject Pearl, and Pearl now scorns the other children and retaliates to their instagations whenever possible. Due to their ostricization, Hester and Pearl are always with together, however Pearl is agonizingly always interested in her mother’s scarlet letter – though Hester considers this irony to be due penance.</p>
    <p>Compared to other Puritan families, Hester is noticably less strict on Pearl, and Pearl is now spoken of as being a demon’s child, who is derived from Hester’s sin, which is still seen as a dishonor to the Puritan community. </p>

      <section data-name="Ch. 7">
    <h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
    <h2>The Governor’s Hall</h2>
    <p>One day, Hester passes by the prison en route to the Governor’s mansion to deliver a pair of gloves, and to ask the Governor to not remove Pearl from her care. Unhappy with Hester's parenting, the colonists have gossiped about adopting Pearl into a more orthodox Puritan family, believing that Pearl’s soul was in jeopardy by living with Hester.</p>
    <p>Today, Pearl is dressed in a scarlet dress that is embroidered with endless gold details – transforming Hester’s daughter into a living embodiment of the scarlet letter. On their way, children attempt to throw mud at them, though Pearl chases them off and returns to her mother with a wide smile.</p>
    <p>Once arrived, Hester encounters an indentured servant who allows her to barge into the mansion to meet with the Governor, after mistaking her demeanor and scarlet letter for signs of high rank. Once inside, Hester and Pearl son find a rose bush, and Pearl begins to scream when Hester refuses to pluck a blossom for her. Though, Pearl ceases when the Governor appears.</p>

      <section data-name="Ch. 8">
    <h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
    <h2>The Elf-Child and the Minister</h2>
    <p>The Governor is with three guests – Minister Wilson, Minister Dimmesdale, and Hester's husband Chillingworth. Chillingworth has befriended Dimmesdale over time, whose health has significantly declined since Hester's public punishment.</p>
    <p>After Hester beseeches the men to leave Pearl in her care, Minister Wilson asks Pearl if she is a Christian child, or otherworldly, like the “superstitious creatures that were thought to have been left in England.” Pearl says she is Hester’s daughter.</p>
    <p>The men then explain they were just discussing the possibility of adopting out Pearl, to which Hester assures them that she can raise Pearl through the shadow of her lessons from the scarlet letter, which could potentially make Pearl wise. After hearing her argument, the men try to test Pearl’s knowledge of Puritan beliefs. and aks Pearl who had created her, to which Pearl responds in an otherworldly demeanor, stating that she was plucked from a wild rose bush that grew by the prison door – which she states simply because she saw the prison and rose bush before the conversation had started. However, Chillingworth smiles as the Governor expresses his belief that Pearl’s soul is at risk and should be adopted.</p>
    <p>Determined, Hester grabs Pearl, declaring that God had given Pearl to her, and that Pearl unavoidably helps Hester earn retribution and ponder over her sins. She then begs Dimmesdale, who was once her Minister, to speak for her. He looks troubled and saddened by the scene.</p>
    <p>Dimmesdale explains that Pearl prevents Hester from further sin, and can create a form of repentance if raised well. Chillingworth comments on Dimmesdale’s attachment to the situation before Pearl runs to Dimmesdale and places his hand against her cheek – which is a rare sign of affection from her. The men finally agree to leave Pearl in Hester’s care.</p>
    <p>As Hester leaves, Mistress Hibbins – the Governor’s sister, who will later be accused of witchcraft – runs into Hester and invites her into the forest at night, stating that she promised to being Hester to “the Black Man”.  Hester rejects the offer proudly and goes home with Pearl – knowing that Pearl is the reason she was not tempted to go to “Satan’s snare”.</p>

      <section data-name="Ch. 9">
    <h1>Chapter Nine</h1>
    <h2>The Leech</h2>
    <p>Chillingworth began attending Dimmesdale’s congregation after arriving at the colony. At the same time, Dimmesdale's health also began to suffer, seemingly from over-devotion to his job, and developed the habit of putting his hand over his heart whenever startled.</p>
    <p>While unsuccessful in convincing Minister Dimmesdale to marry – due to his vow of celibacy - the town does convince Dimmesdale to let Chillingworth medically treat him, seeing Chillingworth as someone sent from God for exactly this purpose. Soon, Dimmesdale allows the physician to move in with him for treatments, and both men quickly take a keen interest in one another – such as Chillingworth’s interest in Dimmesdale hanging religious decor depicting David and Bathsheba, and Nathan the Prophet.</p>
    <p>Chillingworth, meanwhile, had also changed into someone uglier and more evil since his arrival. The change became so pronounced that the town also began to wonder is Satan had come in disguise, to haunt the Reverend and plot against him instead of treat him. The town watched the situation from afar, hoping that the Minister would come out glorious, but instead Dimmesdale only looked sadder with each passing day.</p>

      <section data-name="Ch. 10">
    <h1>Chapter Ten</h1>
    <h2>The Leech and His Patient</h2>
    <p>Chillingworth was once a man of integrity, who sought the truth while making informed judgements. However, he now obsesses with digging into Dimmesdale’s conscious for secrets with no good intentions.</p>
    <p>To others, this unhealthy dynamic would be obvious, but Dimmesdale is unable to see past his depression, which causes him view all people the same, and prevents him from examining Chillingworth as the enemy which he actually is.</p>
    <p>One day, the two roommates discuss the idea of people who die without confessing their secrets. These people are described as cowards, who hide from rightfully deserved shame, and hide their true, tarnished characters while falsely displaying a pure image to the public. During this discussion, they are interrupted by the sound of Pearl outside, and Hester soon appears as well. Eventually, all four notice one another, though, Pearl ends the interaction by beckoning her mother away before the “Black Man” catches her, explaining in her otherworldly way that he has already caught the Minister.</p>
    <p>After Hester and Pearl leave, the two men reflect on how Hester wears her sin publicly, which makes her less miserable than someone who would carry their sins in private. This exchange causes Chillingworth to ask Dimmesdale if he has told him all his grievances – otherwise his treatment would be compromised from his spiritual grievances. However, Dimmesdale sternly explains that he will not confess his sins to a physician who does not deal “medicine for the soul”. He further adds that Roger should not meddle in affairs that between God and a sufferer.</p>
    <p>At a later time, Dimmesdale falls into a deep sleep while in his study, enabling Chillingworth to examine the Minister while he is unconscious. Chillingworth finds a feature on his chest, though it is not described. However, the discovery makes Chillingworth act excitedly and sinisterly, like Satan when “a human soul is lost to heaven, and won into his kingdom”.</p>
  </section>
    
      <section data-name="Ch. 11">
    <h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
    <h2>The Interior of a Heart</h2>
    <p>Chillingworth continually grows more evil while obsessing over revenge. Each day, he alters Dimmesdale’s wellbeing by instigating emotions of agony, fear or any other feeling that creates emotional torment. Ironically, this torment makes Dimmesdale’s sermons more relatable to audiences, who relate to his eloquently conveyed sermons on pain and sin. It is also stated that if Dimmesdale was not so tormented from his own sins, then he would be considered saintly by Puritan beliefs. Though, it is clear that Dimmesdale is suffering from serious guilt over his sins - to the point that his health degrades.</p>
    <p>Secretly, Dimmesdale also harms himself, overly fasts, and constantly holds private vigils for himself throughout the night until he hallucinates of angels, demons or his parents haunting him. He also imagines Hester with Pearl, who points at her mother’s scarlet letter and then towards his chest.</p>
    <p>Dimmesdale holds a deep desire to confess his sin when preaching to his congregation – though he never does.</p>
  </section>
    
      <section data-name="Ch. 12">
    <h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
    <h2>The Minister’s Vigil</h2>
    <p>Dimmesdale arrives at the town’s scaffold late at night and ascends the steps. Without any restraint, he then shrieks – thinking the town will awaken and find him on the scaffold. However, only two people appear before quickly retreating without seeing Dimmesdale.</p>
    <p>Soon, Minister Wilson appears. He is returning home from assisting someone on a deathbed. Dimmesdale daydreams of announcing his presence to Wilson, but remains quiet and surprised by his own instincts. As he grows colder from the night and more paranoid, Hester then appears with Pearl, also coming from the deathbed to take measurements for funeral robes.</p>
    <p>Dimmesdale reveals himself to Hester, and beckons her and Pearl to join him on the scaffold. Once together, he takes Pearl’s hand and feels a rush of warmth and joy. However, Pearl quickly asks if he will stand with her and her mother tomorrow, during the day, on the same scaffold. He refuses, which leads Pearl to try and shake her hand away – though he refuses to let go. She repeats her question, and he says he will eventually stand with them on “the great judgement day”.</p>
    <p>A meteor then crosses the sky, creating a dull red letter A. While they stand together on the scaffold, with Dimmesdale holding his chest, Hester wearing her brooch, and Pearl between them both, Pearl begins to point in the distance at Chillingworth, who is watching them from a distance. This scares Dimmesdale, who asks Hester if she knows the man. Rather than answer, Pearl lectures him and says he is not “bold” or “true” since he refuses to stand with her and her mother on the scaffold at daytime.</p>
    <p>As this happens, Chillingworth nears, and explains that he had also come from the deathbed after administering medical care. He encourages Dimmesdale to return home with him, and Dimmesdale agrees to.</p>
    <p>The next day, after Dimmesdale gives a passionate sermon, a man returns a glove to the Minister, saying that he had found it on the scaffold. Though the man believes that the glove was places on the scaffold by Satan – not by Dimmesdale.</p>

      <section data-name="Ch. 13">
    <h1>Chapter Thirteen</h1>
    <h2>Another View of Hester</h2>
    <p>After 7 years, Hester is shocked by how emotionally and physically destroyed Dimmesdale had appeared on the scaffold, even though he is still intellectually sharp and creates gripping sermons. She now feels a responsibility to help him.</p>
    <p>Over time, Hester’s charity has also led the Puritans to sympathize for her, and even say that the scartlet letterw represents “Able” instead of “Adulterer”. However, Hester doesn’t feel that she deserves the growing kindness.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, for herself, the letter had withered away what was left of Hester’s old personality: her hair now hides in a cap, she wears only plain clothing, and her confidence has changed entirely into humility. Meanwhile, Pearl has continually grown stranger by the day, in her own otherworldly way.</p>
    <p>Over the years, Hester wondered whether Pearl was supposed to exist, and wondered the same for womenkind in general. She pondered over what would be needed to finally allow women to be equal to men in society, and found herself experiencing suicidal urges. However, after the night on the scaffold with Dimmesdale, she now feels new purpose: to help rescue him from his enemy – Chillingworth, her European husband.</p>
    <p>Hester also grows angry with herself, realizing that she condemned Dimmesdale to this torment by not speaking up about Chillingworth's true identity. However, she acknowledges that she no longer feels obligated to her promise thanks to her achieved growth over the years, while Dimmesdale has only fallen in demise.</p>

      <section data-name="Ch. 14">
    <h1>Chapter Fourteen</h1>
    <h2>Hester and the Physician.</h2>
    <p>Hester sees the physician foraging for herbs, and asks Pearl to play nearby as she speaks him. She noticed that he was no longer calm or quiet, but fierce, eager, and guarded with a searing gaze. It is inferred that he symbolically represents a person turning themselves into the devil.</p>
    <p>Hester explains to him that she wants to break her promise to hide his true identity, revealing that she feels a duty to Dimmesdale and can clearly see the mental anguish that Chillingworth is putting him through.</p>
    <p>Chillingworth gaslights Hester, claiming that he does not know what she means and asks for more specific examples, while explaining that he is simply treating Roger as any other physician would. He also explains that Dimmesdale’s character lacks the strength that Hester has, and explains his treatment is the only reason that Dimmesdale is alive.</p>
    <p>Hester responds that it would have been better for Dimmesdale to die than to suffer daily while believing his torment is from due penance, when it is clearly the actions of his worst enemy. Hester also says that Chillingworth was once human, but has now become a fiend.</p>
    <p>Once Chillingworth takes a second to comprehend his new characterization, he responds that the mental anguish will not only continue, but grow. This causes Hester to blames herself for Chillingworth’s pain, and asks why he will not torture her instead. Though he answers that the scarlet letter will be enough to avenge his pain</p>
    <p>After stating that she will tell the truth to Dimmesdale, Chillingworth reveals that he does not care. He foreshadows that all destinies are unavoidable, which leads him to believe that all the good within her has been wasted due to this inevitable destiny. Hester then retorts that his traits have also been wasted when he became an evil being.</p>

      <section data-name="Ch. 15">
    <h1>Chapter Fifteen</h1>
    <h2>Hester and Pearl</h2>
    <p>It is noted that the sun never shines on Chillingworth, who appears to travel with an unavoidable shadow. Hester acknowledges her hate for him, and feels disgust that she had ever married him – deeming it her worst crime. She despises that he ever convinced her that they could be happy together, and deems his actions since to be a betrayal. She believes what he has done has been far worse than her affair – which resulted from her finally finding someone she truly loved rather than developing any hatred. She also wonders if she had received any penance over that past 7 years of wearing the scarlet letter.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Pearl is playing nearby and has taken some seaweed from the ocean and fashioned it into an A on her own chest while playing. She has a desire to understand its significance, which she still does not know.</p>
    <p>Hester sees the seaweed letter and asks Pearl if she known why her mother must wear the scarlet letter. Pearl responds in her otherworldly way that it is the same reason that the Minister always keeps his hand on his heart. For a second, Hester feels a desire to tell everything to Pearl, and finally have a friend to divulge in about her mistakes and sorrows, though she decides against saying anything – realizing that Pearl needs to experience sorrow in a different way. Instead, she tells Pearl that she wears the scarlet letter for the gold thread details, and notes to herself that  this is the first time she has ever lied to anyone about why she wears it. Though, Pearl doesn’t believe the answer, and continues to ask about its significance throughout the day and next morning.</p>
    <p>In general, compared to other Puritan families, Hester is far less strict in Pearl’s upbringing, and over time Pearl has gained the reputation of being a demon’s child that was derived from Hester’s sin, which is still seen as a disgrace upon the New England Puritan community. </p>

    <h1>Chapter Sixteen</h1>
    <h2>A Forest Walk</h2>
    <p>Hester now regularly walks in the forest, hoping to run into Dimmesdale and warn him about Chillingworth. She could visit him at his study, however she wants to ensure that they will be alone, to avoid any interruption and have the opportunity to be themselves without worry of others seeing them.</p>
    <p>Today, Hester goes into the forest, sure that she will see Dimmesdale since he will be traveling home after visiting a Native community of Puritan converts.</p>
    <p>As Pearl and Hester walk, the forest grows chilly and somber, making the sunshine seem distant. At times, the sun appears, though never near Hester. Pearl notices this and says, in her otherworldly way, that the sunlight runs and hides from Hester because of the scarlet letter. Pearl states that she will catch the sunlight and share it with Hester, believing the sunlight won’t flee from her because she does not wear a letter. Pearl plays in the sparse glimmers of sun, and Hester attempts to join, though the sun again vanishes whenever she nears.</p>
    <p>While watching her daughter, Hester again ponders on how Pearl never feels any sorrow, which has prevented her from developing sympathy for others or learning how to appropriately act in such moments. However, Hester is assured that there is still time for Pearl to experience sorrow and develop sympathy for others.</p>
    <p>While waiting for Dimmesdale, Pearl asks to hear a story which she heard from Mistress Hibbins, about the “ugly black man” who offers a book and iron pen to travelers in the forest. Pearl says that people sign their name in blood within his book before he puts his mark on their chest, which glows red and flamelike when people return to him at midnight. In response, Hester says that she has met the man herself, and that the scarlet letter mark she wears is his mark. As they speak, the forest around them grows solemn, which frustrates Pearl, who thinks the forest should be cheery.</p>
    <p>Soon, the Minister appears, with his hand over his chest, and Hester asks Pearl to go play nearby and wait for her to be called back. Before leaving, Pearl asks her mom is the Minister has the mark on his chest, but does not show it publicly. Avoiding the question, Hester tells the child to run and play instead.</p>

    <h1>The Pastor and His Parishioner</h1>
    <h2>Pearl</h2>
    <p>Hester beckons Dimmesdale into the forest, where they ask one another if they are at peace. Dimmesdale explains that he is not, due to his religious beliefs, leading Hester to retort that everyone admires him. However, he says this only brings him more misery instead. Though, believing that Dimmesdale has repented, Hester says his current life is just as holy as it was before their affair, however he says that he should have quit his job as the Minister and revealed that he was the Pearl’s father. He also says that he believes Hester was fortunate to have her sin known and expressed through the scarlet letter, rather than have the sin burn in secret. He says he wishes someone knew of his secret, rather than no one know and have the constant feeling of hypocrisy. This causes Hester to finally reveal that Chillingworth already knows.</p>
    <p>Hester feels guilt knowing that Chillingworth used his status as a physician to inflict torment on Dimmesdale – who she still loves. She prefers death over confessing to her knowledge of Chillingworth being her husband and his closest colleague, and begs for his forgiveness after revealing the truth, and stating that she had inevitably enabled the deception to continue for years. After listening, Dimmesdale refuses to forgive Hester, and grows angry with himself, knowing he should have recognized the physician’s true intentions.</p>
    <p>Hester continues to ask for forgiveness, dreading that he is now frowning at her after being the only person who had never done so. Eventually, he calms and forgives her, and states that he knows they are not the worst sinners in the world – and that Chillingworth had sinned worse than they had. Hester also assures Dimmesdale that Chillingworth will not reveal their secret, but adds that Dimmesdale must no longer reside with Chillingworth. However, Dimmesdale acts helpless and says he can’t leave, causing Hester to tell him that he must grow stronger.</p>
    <p>Soon, she explains that they should run away together, stating that the world is far larger than the colony they live at. Dimmesdale says it is his destiny to stay, though Hester insists this is not true, and that he can be the person he was born to be, rather than the person he has become since their affair. Suddenly, the Minister feels hope from her words, and begins to agree with her idea with new enthusiasm.</p>

    <h1>Chapter Eighteen</h1>
    <h2>18.	A Flood of Sunshine</h2>
    <p>Dimmesdale feels a mix of fear, joy, and admiration towards Hester for saying what he secretly desires but won’t allow himself to say or think. He analyzes how her life on the fringes of society has allowed made her independent and unafraid of the community’s standards, while he was stuck in the middle of every norm, prejudice, regulation, and principle that the society demanded from a Minister. He also reflects on how guilt can damage the soul of a person beyond repair.</p>
    <p>Now, however, for the first time since the affair, Dimmesdale feels hope and freedom, and acknowledges that he wants to spend his life with Hester, who he compares Hester to an angel.</p>
    <p>To signal and prove that the past is behind them, Hester now pulls off the scarlet letter, throws it away, lets down her hair, and feels her youth, appeal, and confidence return. The sun then finally shines of her, and the forest changes from somber to cheerful.</p>
    <p>In excitement, Hester begins to call over Pearl to introduce her to the Minister – her father. The Minister is nervous, and warns Hester that children usually don’t enjoy his company. Hester assures him that all will be well, and beckons Pearl over while she plays in the sunlight in the distance – looking other worldly. However, Pearl nears slowly as she sees the Minister.</p>

    <h1>Chapter Nineteen</h1>
    <h2>The Child at the Brook-Side</h2>
    <p>Hester and the Minister discuss Pearl as Hester calls her over, and Dimmesdale reflects on the only two times he had interacted with Pearl – the day at the Governor’s mansion, when she was nice to him after he argued for Pearl to remain within her mother’s custody, and the night on the scaffold.</p>
    <p>Pearl finally nears, but refuses to cross the brook separating them. She simply stares at the couple, and Dimmesdale senses an otherworldly peculiarity about her that arouses fear to the situation. Hester continues to beckon Pearl, but Pearl only stares between the two and wonders to herself about what they relation is to one another. Dimmesdale sees Pearl looking between him and directly at his hand on his chest before she finally raises her hand and points at her mother’s chest, with a significant frown, before she begins to stamp in place.</p>
    <p>Hester begins to get stern with Pearl for not crossing the brook, which results in Pearl having a shrieking temper tantrum – all while she continues to point at her mother’s chest. Hester then realizes that the missing scarlet letter is what’s bothering Pearl, and the Minister asks Hester to make the tantrum stop by any means.</p>
    <p>Hester sighs in dread before asking Pearl to bring the brooch to her, which now lies near Pearl. Instead, Pearl demands that Hester pick it up herself. Out of guilt, Hester obliges feeling that the request is appropriate in its own symbolic way, though she daydreams of throwing it into the ocean as soon as they all leave together.</p>
    <p>Hester feels a returning sense of doom as she places it back on – as though she reassumed her destiny of penance. She then hides her hair under her cap, and her youth and joy instantly leave, along with the sunshine that is against avoiding her.</p>
    <p>Pearl finally crosses the brook, stating that her Hester is indeed the mother she knows. She shows a rare display of tenderness to her mother with a kiss, but then kisses the scarlet letter as well. Hester berates Pearl for the unkind gesture, though Pearl ignores the statement and instead asks why the Minister is with them.</p>
    <p>Hester tries to introduce the two. and asks Pearl if she will show him love, though Pearl asks if the Minister will love them in return and return to town with them hand-in-hand. The mother says they will not return together, but says they will in the future, adding that she loves the Minister and asks if Pearl will too. Though, Pearl again ignores the question, and asks if he will always walk with his hand over his heart. Hester now grows cross from this response, though Pearl obviously feeling jealousy towards the Minister for having the affections of her mother, who she has never had to share before.</p>
    <p>The Minister finally tries to kiss Pearl in an act of tenderness, though Pearl rejects the gesture and runs to the brook to wash away the kiss. After, she doesn’t return and watches Hester Dimmesdale from afar.</p>

    <h1>Chapter Twenty</h1>
    <h2>The Minister in a Maze</h2>
    <p>Hester, Pearl and Dimmesdale now return to the colony, though not together.</p>
    <p>In the forest, Dimmesdale and Hester had agreed to move to Europe and settle in a city – since he was not strong enough for a rural lifestyle, and was more comfortable in developed cities that abided by norms and societal standards. They agree to leave by ship, and Hester will speak with a captain and crew that she is acquainted with due to her charity. They will leave in 4 days, after he delivers a final sermon during Election Day. Dimmesdale is happy with the idea that he will finish his duties appropriately.</p>
    <p>Dimmesdale is now noticeably more energetic, and feels that he is looking at life through new eyes. He also begins secretly feeling impulses to commit sinful acts as he walks by people. He fears the new impulses, but also finds an odd humor within them, and wonders if they result from unknowingly agreeing to a wicked oath within the forest. As he wonders this, Mistress Hibbins nears him and remarks on his visit in the forest. Dimmesdale insists that he was in the forest with nothing but Puritan of intentions, however she ignores his answer and says they will meet in the forest together at midnight.</p>
    <p>Dimmesdale now questions if he has “sold” himself to the devil, and begins to grow angry at himself for being tempted by happiness, when he knew his soul was tainted by the “poison” of sin.</p>
    <p>Once home, Chillingworth arrives and offers his medical services to help him prepare the Minister for his Election Sermon, though Dimmesdale rejects the offer and states that he will no longer need any medical assistant – now knowing that Chillingworth is actually his “bitterest enemy”. The physician tries to insist on him changing his mind, saying that he looks as though he may not live past another year. Though Dimmesdale says he would simply leave into another world, and hopefully a better one, if that were to pass.</p>
    <p>After Chillingworth leaves, Dimmesdale eats and then begins to write a new sermon after throwing his old sermon into the fire. </p>

    <h1>Chapter Twenty-One</h1>
    <h2>Pearl</h2>
    <p>Hester and Pearl arrive at the market on Election Day, and Hester feels and extra sense of celebration since this will be the last time anyone will see the scarlet letter or view her as a lifelong victim of its sentence. Through all of this, Hester also feels some guilt over her emotions.</p>
    <p>Pearl is also very excited, to the point that she almost emulates the excitement which Hester is hiding herself. She asks about the celebration, why people are gathering, and oddly remarks that the ugly black man should not nod at her if he attends, but says that he may nod at Hester because she wears the scarlet letter and grey clothing.</p>
    <p>Hester explains that everyone has gathered for Election Day, which will involve a procession in which the Minister will partake. Pearl asks if the Minister will reach out for them as he passes the by, though Hester says he will not and states that Pearl should not greet him. Pearl then calls Dimmesdale “a strange, sad man”, elaborating that he will only hold them, love them, and call to them at night or in a forest, yet will not do the during the day in front of all the people. Instead, he pretends to not know them, and they are expected do the same back. Hester then tries to end the conversation, saying that she does not understand how things are.</p>
    <p>As they wait, the crowd is described as only slightly less somber than usual. The celebrations include no music, acts, entertainment, or singing due to the disciplines and laws of the community, which are only enabled because of the mutual sentiment expressed within the community. However, within the crowd, it is noted that the sailors are celebrating in a more open way by committing acts what are forbidden to Puritans, such as drinking from flasks and smoking tobacco.</p>
    <p>Hester soon notices the captain of the ship she will be leaving on, and he is speaking to Chillingworth.</p>
    <p>After the two men separate, the captain walks to Hester and states that the ship will be healthy and free of outbreaks thanks to a physician who will join them – Chillingworth, who claimed to be traveling with along with Hester’s party, and also claims to be a close from of Dimmesdale’s. Roger smiles at Hester from a distance while the captain reveals this information to her.</p>

      <section data-name="Ch. 22">
    <h1>Chapter Twenty-two</h1>
    <h2>The Procession</h2>
    <p>Before Hester has time to consider what she has just learned, the procession music begins and the local leaders pass by, including the Minister, who is noticeably enlivened. Hester’s mood, however, begins to change as he passes without one glance, which she was not expecting. She pains over their closeness in the forest, but now he seems distant, proud, and unattainable in demeanor. She even feels that their bond is not real, and that she cannot forgive him for the distance she is feeling.</p>
    <p>After he passes by, Pearl asks if he is the same man who kissed her in the forest. Hester says to not speak about this publicly, but Pearl continues, and says he looked different, otherwise she would have run to him and asked for a kiss. Pearl then asks Hester what the Minister would have done if she asked for a kiss, and Hester replies that it was not an appropriate time to ask for a kiss.</p>
    <p>Mistress Hibbins now runs into Hester, and states that the Minister is no longer the same man who left the forest with her. Hester denies that she met with Dimmesdale in the forest, though Hibbins ignores the remark, and says that Hester wears her mark openly, while the Minister is hiding his. Though she also foretells that Dimmesdale’s bond to his mark will inevitably force him to reveal his true self to the public. Pearl takes interest in the conversation, and Hibbins tells the her that she will see the mark soon.</p>
    <p>As everyone settles to hear Dimmesdale’s sermon, Hester stands next to the scaffold to listen from outside. She is moved by the sermon, which is inspired by feelings of complaint, guilt, sorrow, the desire to tell a secret, and beseeching for sympathy and forgiveness. As she listens, Pearl walks away to play and encounters a sailor to gives her a message to relay to her mother – that the accompanying physician, Roger, has told them that he will come to the ship with Dimmesdale himself, so Hester should only worry about boarding the ship with Pearl. Pearl relays the message to Hester, which dampens her sprits and forces her to suddenly notices all the people around her, who are not from the area, looking directly at the scarlet letter brooch with a rude intrusiveness. She feels that the Minister is seen as saintly, and is stationed above everyone else – while Hester is wearing her scarlet letter in the marketplace next to the scaffold. Ironically, no one would fathom that they were both involved in the affair.</p>

      <section data-name="Ch. 23">
    <h1>Chapter Twenty-three</h1>
    <h2>The Revelation of the Scarlet Letter</h2>
    <p>The crowd returns to the market after the sermon, and everyone is expressing admiration for the Dimmesdale’s sermon, which is as his best sermon yet. The crowd attributes the speech to being derived from his short time remaining to live.</p>
    <p>The Minister now emerges, and it is clearly his life’s proudest moment. Hester, meanwhile, is alone by the scaffold – feeling the Scarlet Letter burn against her chest.</p>
    <p>The music for the procession starts again to escort the leaders to a banquet, and the crowd continues to admire Dimmesdale, however his disposition suddenly looks degraded and deathlike. Reverend John Wilson notices this and offers to help, though Dimmesdale insists on walking alone with a weak gait.</p>
    <p>When he nears the scaffold and sees Hester, the scarlet letter, and Pearl, he pauses then leaves the procession to walk to the scaffold. He beckons Hester and Pearl weakly, though with underlying triumph, and they unite. As this happens, Chillingworth suddenly breaks through the crowd and grabs Dimmesdale, telling him to cast Hester and Pearl away to not tarnish his reputation, though Dimmesdale tells the physician that he is too late and he is ready to end Chillingworth’s instigations.</p>
    <p>Dimmesdale asks for Hester’s support as he finally does what he should have done 7 years ago. They ascend the scaffold in front of the crowd, which look on silently and shocked. Dimmesdale finally begins to admit his long-held secret, before asking Hester if what is happening is better than what they had dreamed of in the forest. She replies that she does not know, and then he continues to admit to his part of the affair. He praises Hester, and begins to say that everyone has a scarlet letter of their own – though theirs still remain secret. He adds that the Devil helped hide his secret, allowing him to walk among the town in praise. He then tears off his ministerial band and opens his shirt to reveal his chest in triumph as the physician falls beside him in defeat. The physician states that Dimmesdale has escaped him, before the Minister returns his attention to Hester and Pearl. He asks Pearl for a kiss, who is suddenly overcome with grief for the first time in her life as she walks over and kisses him on the cheek. It is inferred that Pearl’s time anguishing her mother into penance will now be over, as Pearl finally learns how to share sympathy.</p>
    <p>Dimmesdale finally says goodbye to Hester, and tells her to focus on their mutual sin instead of pondering if they will meet again in the afterlife. He believes that it was vain hope for them to ever meet in an “everlasting and pure reunion”, and gives a final praise for God, stating that his predestined will has now finished. Dimmesdale then dies on the scaffold.</p>

      <section data-name="Ch. 24">
    <h1>Chapter Twenty-four</h1>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The story never reveals what was on Dimmesdale’s chest. Some say it was a scarlet letter imprinted from self-mutilation, others claim the physician caused it to appear instead, and some say the mark appeared simply from Dimmesdale’s own remorse causing it to manifest. Others deny that any mark existed at all.</p>
    <p>The town believed that Dimmesdale had made his death a final parable for how all people are sinners alike, and it is described how Dimmesdale’s story reveals the stubborn characteristic of people to stubbornly uphold certain people, even when proven to be false. However, it is stated that the most important lesson to gain from the novel is “Be true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred!”</p>
    <p>After losing his life’s purpose of seeking revenge against Dimmesdale, Chillingworth died one year later. Though, he left a a large amount of property to Pearl – making her the richest heiress of the colonies at the time, and instantly changing Pearl’s status within Puritan society.</p>
    <p>Hester and Pearl then left New England, and the scarlet letter grew to be known as a legend by those who remained. Though, years later, Hester returned to her cottage and began to wear the scarlet letter again – though without Pearl.</p>
    <p>Home again in the cottage, and wearing the scarlet letter, Hester surrounded herself with expensive items which she never used, and sewed baby’s clothing for what the assumed to be Pearl’s own family. Pearl would happily allow Hester to live with her, however Hester chose to return to New England instead - where her sin, sorrow, and penitence remained.</p>
    <p>The scarlet letter had lost it previous stigma, and converted into a symbol the elicited sorrow, awe, and even reverence.</p>
    <p>Before passing away, Hester grew sure that future men and women would reach a new level of mutual happiness, and her character was described as being buried in King Chapel, next to Dimmesdale. While they both lay in separate graves, they share a single engraved headstone:</p>
    <p>“On a field, sable, the letter A, gules.”</p>
