                <p>Between Nick's home and New York City is a location referred to as the Valley of the Ashes. At the time, this location was a dump site for garbage and ashes collected from the city.</p><p>The area was filled with ridges, hills, chimneys, smoke, and a billboard that advertised an optomistrist’s practice in nearby Queens. There was also a a river with a drawbridge that would often delay the trains and traffic, and a single yellow-bricked building that stood on the edge of the town. The building housed three shops, one of which was a garage called "Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold".</p>

The grass was overgrown as he walked up the front stairs and he cleared away some graffiti that was scratched into the stairs. He then walked around to the private beach, clearly imagining the music and voices from the parties that had just been occurring every Saturday.</p><p>He laid on the sand, looked across the bay, and saw the green light shining from what used to be Daisy’s dock. He reflected on what Gatsby’s reaction had once been to it.</p></div>
