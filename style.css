                <div class = "paragraph2Title">Who were the Puritans?</div>

                <div class = "introductionWords">For more than a millennium, Catholicism maintained its position as a major religion throughout Europe. However, in 1517, Martin Luther nailed a list of objections to Catholic beliefs on a church door in Germany, officially showing the rise of Protestants.</div>

                <div class = "introductionWords">Protestantism was a new branch of Christianity, which sought to separate itself from Catholicism and practice Christian beliefs in its own way. Its philosophies spread quickly, along with a decimating intolerance from all sides – such as King Henry VIII (1491-1547), who cruely persecuted Catholic followers, followed by Queen Mary I (1516-1558), his daughter, who then persecuted Protestants so terribly that she earned the nickname Bloody Mary.</div>

                <div class = "introductionWords">As Protestants grew, so did the Puritans – who believed that Protestantism was too lenient.</div>

                <div class = "introductionWords">Facing persecution in Europe, hundreds of Puritans left to establish new communities in Massachusetts Bay Colony (1630), and a separate sect went to begin Plymouth Colony (1620) - whose settlers barely survived upon arrival, and were taught to adapt by the Natives who welcomed them.</div>

                <div class = "introductionWords">Both colonies were governed by orthodox religious principles, with rigid laws and severe punishments. Also - similar to other religious Europeans of the time - Puritan leaders were intolerant of religious differences or diversity, and became cruel and unjust to the Native communities that once saved their first Colonial settlers.</div>

                <div class = "introductionWords">A core belief - which was central to Puritan society - was the idea that all people were pre-ordained for salvation or damnation before their birth. Thus, everyone was believed to either be immanently wicked and destined for damnation, or pre-destined for salvation by living in Puritan Grace. With this view, all committed sins were seen as a reflection someone's destiny for damnation, and sins were considered both irreversible and unforgivable.</div>

                <div class = "introductionWords">This belief heavily dictates the interactions which occur within The Scarlet Letter.</div>
